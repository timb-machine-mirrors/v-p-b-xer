# xer

Command line byte encoding swiss-army knife. The goal is to be the `iconv` of byte stream encodings.

Have you ever spent precious time converting something like `0xde, 0xad,\r\n0xbe, 0xef` to `\xde\xad\xbe\xef`? If so, then `xer` is for you.

## TODO

* Signed values (as you know, three billion devices run Java)
* More formats (PR's welcome)
* More tests
